<h2 align="center"> 🖖 Hello there, Welcome to my Github profile. <br> <br>  My name is Walter Piragine <br>. </h2>

### I'm Brazilian from Fortaleza - CE and a self-taught programmer. <br> <br> 
My journey with programming began in the mid-2020, exactly in the middle of the pandemic 😷. <br>I wanted to make a snake game (yes that one, in the old Nokia phones), after several attempts I gave up 😓😩🥵.<br> Then I remembered Master Yoda's  quote: "Do or do not, there is no try." <br> I filled myself with desire and I really wanted to do it!!! So I sat down in front of the computer again and since then I have fallen more and more in love with logic, syntax, data structures, algorithms, and this whole universe that is programming.
#   
#### For now my GitHub repositories are only about summaries and study projects
#   
###  🔭 I’m currently working on: (most of the time) I'm in front of the PC studying. But I also assemble and sell hardware (PC's) in tenders for local government (councils selling). My main interests in programming are Algorithms and Data Science.


##  🌱 I’m currently studying and the Tech I use:

### ⚡ Fun fact: I am a huge star wars fan and I like to follow F1 #GOFERRARI#, and when I'm not working, or studying, or with my fiancée I'm probably taking care of the garden or playing some video-game 🎮🕹️
