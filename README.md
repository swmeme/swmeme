<h2 align="center"> ðŸ–– Hello there, Welcome to my Github profile. <br> <br>  My name is Walter Piragine <br>. </h2>

### I'm Brazilian from Fortaleza - CE and a self-taught programmer. <br> <br> 
My journey with programming began in the mid-2020, exactly in the middle of the pandemic ðŸ˜·. <br>I wanted to make a snake game (yes that one, in the old Nokia phones), after several attempts I gave up ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜©ðŸ¥µ.<br> Then I remembered Master Yoda's  quote: "Do or do not, there is no try." <br> I filled myself with desire and I really wanted to do it!!! So I sat down in front of the computer again and since then I have fallen more and more in love with logic, syntax, data structures, algorithms, and this whole universe that is programming.

#### For now my GitHub repositories are only about summaries and study projects
