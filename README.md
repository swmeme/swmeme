### I'm Brazilian (Fortaleza - CE) and a self-taught programmer.
My journey with programming began in the mid-2020, exactly in the middle of the pandemic 😷. <br>I wanted to make a snake game (yes that one in the old Nokia phones), after several attempts I gave up 😓😩🥵. 


### - 🔭 I’m currently working on: Mounting and selling hardware, mostly in tenders for local government (councils selling). But most of the time I'm in front of the PC studying.

## - 🌱 I’m currently studying:
